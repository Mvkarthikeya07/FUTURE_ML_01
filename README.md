# 📊 Sales & Demand Forecasting for Businesses

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights

* 📈 Time-series sales forecasting using **ARIMA**
* 🧠 End-to-end **machine learning pipeline** (data → model → insights)
* 📊 Model evaluation using **RMSE** and **MAPE**
* 🖥️ **Flask-based web application** with interactive charts (Chart.js)
* 💼 **Business-oriented insights** for inventory and revenue planning
* ✅ Fully compliant with **Future Interns – Task 1 guidelines**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Sales & Demand Forecasting System** is an end-to-end machine learning and analytics application designed to analyze historical sales data and accurately forecast future demand.

The primary goal of this system is to help businesses move away from intuition-based planning and adopt **data-driven decision-making** for:

* Inventory optimization
* Revenue forecasting
* Operational and supply chain planning

Unlike basic forecasting scripts, this project focuses equally on **model accuracy, visualization, and business interpretation**, making it suitable for real-world enterprise use cases.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many organizations rely on manual estimation or intuition to forecast sales demand, which often leads to:

* ❌ Over-stocking or under-stocking
* ❌ Revenue loss
* ❌ Inefficient operational planning

This project addresses these challenges by applying **time-series forecasting techniques** to historical sales data and generating **reliable, interpretable future demand predictions**.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

The system follows a structured and professional machine learning workflow:

1. Load historical sales data
2. Clean and preprocess time-series data
3. Train a forecasting model using **ARIMA**
4. Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **MAPE**
5. Serve predictions through a **Flask backend**
6. Visualize results using an interactive **Chart.js dashboard**
7. Translate forecasts into **business-friendly insights**

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

* Time-series sales data (monthly)
* Features: `Date`, `Sales`
* Dataset Type: Business-like / simulated or historical dataset
* Used exclusively for forecasting and evaluation

---

## 📈 Forecasting Model

The project uses the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model due to its:

* Strong performance on short- to medium-term forecasts
* Ability to capture trends and seasonality in sales data
* High interpretability for business stakeholders
* Suitability for limited historical datasets common in real businesses

The model forecasts **sales demand for the next 6 months** based on historical patterns.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

To ensure reliability and transparency, the model is evaluated using:

### 🔹 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

* Measures the average prediction error in actual sales units
* Indicates how far predictions deviate from real values

### 🔹 MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

* Measures prediction accuracy in percentage terms
* Easily understandable by non-technical stakeholders

Both metrics are displayed as **KPI cards** on the dashboard.
